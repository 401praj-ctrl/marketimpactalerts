    "impact_description": "While the news directly concerns Jeffrey Epstein and New Mexico, the potential for further revelations regarding his associates and financial dealings could indirectly impact Indian companies or individuals who may have had connections to him or his network. The reputational risk associated with any links to Epstein is significant. However, the direct impact on the Indian stock market is expected to be minimal, as the news is largely focused on legal proceedings in the US and New Mexico. The 'Epstein Island' association carries significant reputational risk, and any Indian entities found to have had dealings with Epstein could face scrutiny and potential negative sentiment. The Drift Effect suggests a potential for lingering negative sentiment even after the initial news cycle fades.",

    "article_summary": "The New Mexico Attorney General has ordered the reopening of a criminal investigation into alleged crimes committed at Jeffrey Epstein's Zorro Ranch, prompted by newly released US Department of Justice documents. This follows previous investigations that were closed to avoid overlap with federal probes, and a new parliamentary committee has also been formed to investigate Epstein's activities in the state. The ranch was recently sold and the new owner has pledged cooperation.",
